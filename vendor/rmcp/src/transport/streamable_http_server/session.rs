//! Session management for the Streamable HTTP transport.
//!
//! A *session* groups the logically related interactions between a single MCP
//! client and the server, starting from the `initialize` handshake. The server
//! assigns each session a unique [`SessionId`] (returned to the client via the
//! `Mcp-Session-Id` response header) and the client includes that ID on every
//! subsequent request.
//!
//! Two tool calls carrying the same session ID come from the same logical
//! session; different IDs mean different clients or conversations.
//!
//! # Implementations
//!
//! * [`local::LocalSessionManager`] — in-memory session store (default).
//! * [`never::NeverSessionManager`] — rejects all session operations, used
//!   when stateful mode is disabled.
//!
//! # Custom session managers
//!
//! Implement the [`SessionManager`] trait to back sessions with a database,
//! Redis, or any other external store.
